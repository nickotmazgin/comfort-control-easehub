### 📥 Which Zip Should I Download?

Every release publishes two artifacts; choose based on your GNOME Shell version:
- GNOME 42–44 → download the file named `comfort-control@nickotmazgin-42-44.shell-extension.zip`
- GNOME 45–47 → download the file named `comfort-control@nickotmazgin-45-47.shell-extension.zip`

Both zips include compiled schemas to ensure Preferences open correctly.
Find them on the Releases page: https://github.com/nickotmazgin/comfort-control-easehub/releases

### 🧪 Packaging (CI)

On tag push (`v*`), GitHub Actions builds `comfort-control@nickotmazgin.shell-extension.zip` and publishes a release automatically.
